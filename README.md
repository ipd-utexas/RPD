## About IPD

Founded in January 2013, Innovations for Peace and Development (IPD) is a research program at The University of Texas at Austin with the mission to provide a space for interdisciplinary, policy-relevant research on global conflict, foreign aid and poverty alleviation. At its core, IPD provides mentored research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. We are very proud that since our start over 160 students have been involved with IPD, as student researchers, summer interns, and graduate research fellows and assistants. â€‹Our students have gained invaluable professional and research skills and gone on to intern and work in the international arena. We welcome students across all disciplines and levels.
